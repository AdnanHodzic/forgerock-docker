  # Below is an example of mounting a volume so you can do
  # Local development.
  # Note on MacOS / Docker you need to setup Docker Machine so it
  # shares and mounts your home directory onto the Docker Machine.
  # This should be done for you..
  # If your home dir is not mounted, the volumne mounts are relative to the VM - not your
  # Mac
  volumes:
    - /Users/warren/.openig:/root/openig
